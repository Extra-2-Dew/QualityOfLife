<details>
	<summary>
		<b>Resolution selection list in graphics options might duplicate or miss some resolutions</b>
	</summary>

	In vanilla, you may be missing some resolution selections because of a bug where it could duplicate
	and skip over some selections based on how many total selections your display supports. In one
	known case, this caused 1440p to not be selectable in windowed mode.
